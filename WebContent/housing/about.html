	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>
		The NESTS application was built using IBM Watson <a
			href="http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/developercloud/tradeoff-analytics.html" target="_blank">Tradeoff
			Analytics</a>. NESTS allows the user to search for <a
			href="http://www.hudhomestore.com/Home/Index.aspx?sLanguage=ENGLISH" target="_blank">FHA-eligible homes in
			America</a>, using real-time data.
	<p>It is as simple as picking a state, filtering by criteria such as price, beds, and baths, and then allowing
		Tradeoff Analytics to help you compare homes to make the best choice.
	<p>What sets NESTS apart from other real estate sites starts from the moment you begin searching. The application
		adds blue flags to homes that may not offer the best value to the user, and provides the user with other selections
		which present greater value, all while considering multiple criteria. It then presents this data using Tradeoff Analytics' novel
		interactive visuals. The service exposes tradeoffs between options, and allows the user to compare and explore in more detail.
		By that, users searching for a home, make a better informed decision.
